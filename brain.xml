        <pattern>WHAT ARE BLACK HOLES</pattern>
        <template>Black holes are created when a star dies and collapses in on itself. Right at the moment of its creation, a gigantic explosion is released which is called a supernova. This supernova creates so much light and energy that it can be seen billions of light years away! After a black hole is born, it will suck in all matter and light through gravity and grow as it consumes more and more.</template>
