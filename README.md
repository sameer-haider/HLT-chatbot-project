# Interstellar T.A.R.S Chatbot

Welcome to the Interstellar T.A.R.S chatbot, an engaging AI assistant built with [AIML](http://www.aiml.foundation/index.html), the XML-based language developed by the A.L.I.C.E AI Foundation and Dr. Richard Wallace. This chatbot was crafted as part of the CS 4395 - Human Language Technologies course at the University of Texas at Dallas.

As a tribute to Christopher Nolan's masterpiece *Interstellar*, our chatbot is aptly named **T.A.R.S** - inspired by the AI assistant from the film. **T.A.R.S** is designed to answer any questions you may have about the movie.

## Key Features

**Natural Language Processing**: Leveraging modern NLP techniques to better understand and respond to user queries:

* **Cosine Similarity**: This algorithm measures the similarity between user input and pre-defined responses, enabling the chatbot to deliver accurate and relevant responses.

* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: NER helps the chatbot to understand and classify entities (like names, locations, and expressions of times) within the user's input, resulting in a more contextual and meaningful conversation.

## Technologies
Key python libraries used:

* [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)

* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
